                <p>By offering a completely integrated solution with real-time tracking,
                     nutritional management, and individualized suggestions, 
                     our To-Be rich picture approach seeks to overcome the drawbacks of existing solutions.
                      The existing solution has a very organized data management system 
                      where the data are maintained in different ways but in our proposed 
                      system we are trying to solve this problem by collecting data of the users 
                      through a single system that maintains the whole data process. To do this, 
                      our system makes use of MySQL databases for the centralized storing of
                       patient demographics, diagnosis data, physician details, 
                       hospital information, and other vital data, guaranteeing data 
                       confidentiality, integrity, and convenient access for authorized users. 
                       Our system solves the problem of scheduling and taking appointments
                        through the reception it has become fully automated which gives a perfect
                         end-to-end system to book appointments with the physician as per their 
                         schedule and the time given by the physicians will be noted to 
                         acknowledge the effort of the physicians. </p>
